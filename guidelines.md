Welcome,please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:  
1. Be polite > don’t be rude to anyone and respect others. Remember there is a person behind the screen and that your words affect people.
2. Don’t troll. > We appreciate and welcome criticism towards writers here, but comments that add no value to the discussion or that are merely insulting would be deleted without exception.
3. Spam? Goodbye. > We understand that you may make thousands of dollars working from home, however, we are not interested. Please refrain from posting or we’ll give you a hand and show both you and your post the door.

To put it in a simple sentence, our guidelines boil down to “Don’t be a dick”. If you don’t follow any of these guidelines, not only will our moderators remove the comment but we may also ban you from participating in the discussions.  
If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’ – our moderators highly appreciate your support!  
Happy commenting!

欢迎,请务必遵守以下准则: 

1. 要有礼貌 > 请不要对任何人无礼,尊重他人。请记住,屏幕后面有一个人,你的话会影响人们。  
2. 请不要挑衅 > 我们赞赏并欢迎对作家的批评，但对无意义的抬杠或只是侮辱性的评论将无一例外地删除。
3. 请不要发布广告 > 我们知道您在家工作可能会赚数千美元，但是，我们不感兴趣。请不要发帖，否则我们会封禁您的留言。

简单的说，我们的准则可以归结为“不要做个混蛋”。如果您不遵循这些准则，我们的版主不仅会删除评论，我们还可能会禁止您参与讨论。  
如果您发现任何违反我们准则的评论，请务必“标记(举报)”或“标记为垃圾留言”——我们的版主非常感谢您的支持!
