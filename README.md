# Tommy's website

Welcome to Tommy's website. This website runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. You write posts using Markdown, and Jekyll automatically compiles these posts into web pages. It's great if you don't want to use something like Medium to host your blog. 

## Jekyll themes

Jekyll themes can change the appearance of a Jekyll website without impacting the content. My website uses a heavily edited version of the default "minima" theme with some additional code for adding tags.

## Gyanl's theme

Gyanl's website has a beautiful design and clear content structure. I use the basic version of minima for my website, but also use some modules of [Gyanl](https://github.com/gyanl/gyanl.github.io).
