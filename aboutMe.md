### My name is Tommy, from Eldia Empire, a citizen of Ymir.

#### I am a rookie software engineer who loves programming. I have two years of experience in software development. I am constantly learning to improve my programming professionalism. I hope that through continuous learning, exploration and practice, summarizing and sharing my experience, I can one day become a software engineering pioneer like Dijkstra, Martin Flower, and Robert Martin.

#### I love music. I like to listen to blues, rock, classical music, pop music, hip-pop, etc., but I am not limited to these styles. I am not limited to English music, Chinese music or music in any language. I Love music with genuine passion and incredible creativity

#### I can play the bamboo flute, acoustic guitar, and electric guitar. The bamboo flute is a skill I learned from my teacher since I was a child. The acoustic guitar is a skill I learned by myself in college. The electric guitar is a skill I learned by myself when I just entered social work. Learning an instrument is a means, playing music is my goal, and I will continue to learn more music skills. By the way, if you want to watch my performance, please follow my TikTok.

#### I insist on fitness, I continue to strengthen my body, continue to make progress, and continue to understand the beauty of this world.

### Finally, and most importantly, I love freedom.
