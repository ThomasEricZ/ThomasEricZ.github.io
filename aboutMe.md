🙇🏻‍♂️  Hello, I'm Tommy, hailing from the Eldia Empire and proudly identifying as a citizen of Ymir.

👨🏻‍💻  I am a passionate software engineer with two years of hands-on experience in the field of software development.

🎵  Beyond coding, I have a deep love for music, cherishing its genuine passion and incredible creativity. Not only do I appreciate listening to music, but I'm also a versatile musician. I can skillfully play the bamboo flute, acoustic guitar, and electric guitar. If you're interested in experiencing my musical performances, feel free to check out my TikTok.

🏋🏻  In addition to my professional and artistic pursuits, I prioritize maintaining a healthy lifestyle through regular exercise.

🕊️  Above all, my love for freedom is a core aspect of who I am. It shapes my perspective on life and influences my choices in both personal and professional spheres.
